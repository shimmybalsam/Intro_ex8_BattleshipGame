=  Description: =

Two programs used in order to play a game of Battleship:

The first program is ship.py, which contains different functions, creating a
ship and specific results for anything that happens to a ship including: moving
in the correct direction per turn, results of being hit by a bomb and being
terminated. Furthermore it has functions which help recreate the ship's
coordinates, damaged cells and intact cells.

The second program is game.py which after initializes the Battleship game using
a list of ships which were built based on the previous ship.py program, after
which plays round by round. Each round the user interactively chooses in which
coordinates to release a bomb, and the ships act accordingly.
The game continues until all ships are destroyed.
